Problem: Longest Balanced Subarray

Definition:
A subarray is called balanced if the number of DISTINCT even numbers 
in the subarray is equal to the number of DISTINCT odd numbers.

Goal:
Return the length of the longest balanced subarray.

Approach (Optimized O(n)):

1. Maintain a HashSet to track distinct elements seen so far.
2. Keep two counters:
      - distinctEven
      - distinctOdd
3. Maintain diff = distinctEven - distinctOdd.
4. Use HashMap to store first occurrence of each diff.
5. If same diff appears again, it means subarray between them is balanced.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
